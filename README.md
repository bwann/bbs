Some files backing my vintage bulletin board system running Wildcat! 4.20 Multiline 10
on MS-DOS, TuxedoCat Lounge BBS  http://www.tuxedocatbbs.com/

### Wildcat! batch files

Various DOS batch files for starting BBS nodes, door programs, maintenance,
backup, and other tasks

### Netfoss files

FOSSIL driver interfacing with modems and telnet server

### UUCP / wcGate files

The BBS has Internet e-mail support by dialing out to a Raspberry Pi
and performing a UUCP transfer.

These are the files on the Wildcat! side of things.

### Qmodem call completion testing

Used for evaluating modems and analog telephone adapters, a Qmodem script that calls the BBS over and over simulating
a caller downloading a file.

### www files

Some stuff that runs on the webserver to assist with the BBS (no winserver here)

### x25.md

Cisco IOS configuration for simulating an X.25 PAD and connecting to the Telebahn retro X.25 network

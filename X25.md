# X.25 connectivity

TuxedoCat Lounge is a participant in the Telebahn X.25 retro network.

## History

X.25 was a packet-switched wide area network technology that pre-dates network
technology such as frame relay.  If you've heard of Tymnet, that was an X.25
data network that connected thousands of companies, schools, and government
agenties in the 1970s-1980s.

BBSs could also be connected to the X.25 network, letting users from all over
the country or globe to access the board. This was often used to avoid
long-distance telephone charges by accessing a local X.25 POP first, such
as Tymnet, and then making an X.28 connection (similar to today's telnet).

BBSs were typically connected via an X.25 PAD, a device that connected to
the X.25 network and then broke out individual RS-232 serial connections
to the BBS. The BBS saw incoming X.25 users as just another serial modem
connection. Some BBS software such as Major BBS had an add-on ISA card that
had an integrated X.25 PAD.

## Connectivity

A Cisco 2650 XM running Advanced Enterprise IOS serves as a X.25 PAD for
TuxedoCat lounge. A custom-made serial cable connects the Cisco 2650's
aux port to a serial port on the BBS computer, providing all necessary
rolled pinout, null modem, and carrier detect signals. A custom 
configuration on the router and the BBS provides in-band ring detection.
This provides inbound connectivity and gracefully disconnects the user
from the BBS and router when the session has ended, avoiding hanging
connections.

This only provides for a single user to be connected from X.25 at a time.
If there was demand I'd likely use an async card to wire in multiple
serial lines to the BBS.

This isn't perfect though, for some reason Wildcat! will spend several
seconds trying to initialize the serial port, flapping CD several times,
trying to send some default modem AT commands even when no init string
is configured in the .MDM file!  But generally after 20-30 seconds of
starting the node or a user disconnecting, it will recycle the node.

### Cisco IOS configuration

X.25-over-TCP, XOT

This is the relevant IOS configuration to act as a PAD and/or handle
reverse-telnet connections. Other common directives are omittied and
assumed to already be there.

XOT translate is not yet used, but I'd like to use it in the future.

## Using Telebahn X.25 connectivity

A quick way to get started to try out Telebahn and TuxedoCat Lounge is to
download `xotpad`, a software X.25 PAD written in Rust.

This requires Rust and Cargo.

```
git clone https://github.com/lowobservable/xotpad.git
cd xotpad
cargo build

Binary is then in target/debug/xotpad

```

Once `xotpad` is built, it can be used similar to this, where x25.wann.net
is my XOT endpoint and 51010000 is the BBS NUA.

```
cd xotpad
./target/debug/xotpad -g x25.wann.net 51010000
```

There are other sites available on the Telebahn X.25 network to check out,
visit X25.org for more information.

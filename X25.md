# X.25 connectivity

TuxedoCat Lounge is a participant in the [Telebahn X.25 retro network](http://www.x25.org).

XOT address: x25.wann.net, NUA 51010000

This is to document the Cisco IOS config and serial cable pinout I used, to go with other
BBS configuration information in this repo.

## History

X.25 was a packet-switched wide area network technology that pre-dates frame relay.
If you've heard of Tymnet or Telenet those were commercial X.25 data network that
connected thousands of companies, schools, and government agencies in the 1970s-1990s.

BBSs could also be connected to the X.25 network, letting users from all over
the country or globe to access the board. This was often used to avoid
long-distance telephone charges by accessing a local X.25 POP first, such
as Tymnet, and then making an X.28 session (similar to today's telnet) across
the network to the remote hosts.

BBSs were typically connected via an X.25 PAD, a device that connected to
the X.25 network and then broke out individual RS-232 serial connections
to the BBS. The BBS saw incoming X.25 users as just another serial modem
connection. Some BBS software such as Major BBS had an add-on ISA card (PC Xnet) that
had an integrated X.25 PAD and eliminated the need for serial ports.

An example PAD in the Wildcat! BBS sysop guide is the Microtronix CSI-X.25:

## Connectivity

A Cisco 2650 XM running Advanced Enterprise Services IOS serves as a X.25 PAD for
TuxedoCat Lounge. A custom-made serial cable connects the Cisco 2650's
aux port to a serial port on the BBS computer, providing all necessary
rolled pinout, null modem, and carrier detect signals. A custom 
configuration on the router and the BBS provides in-band ring detection.
This provides inbound connectivity and gracefully disconnects the user
from the BBS and router when the session has ended, avoiding hanging
connections.

A blog post I wrote goes into far more detail about how I built this serial
cable, the problems along the way, and why I had to build this exactly
like I did: https://binaryfury.wann.net/2024/08/connecting-a-bbs-to-a-cisco-aux-port-gracefully/

This only provides for a single user to be connected from X.25 at a time.
If there was demand I'd likely use an async card to wire in multiple
serial lines to the BBS.

This isn't perfect though, for some reason Wildcat! will spend several
seconds trying to initialize the serial port, flapping CD several times,
trying to send some default modem AT commands even when no init string
is configured in the .MDM file!  But generally after 20-30 seconds of
starting the node or a user disconnecting, it will recycle the node.

This file on Github is mainly to present the IOS configuration. For the BBS
configuration, please refer to the above blog post.

### Serial cable

Cisco 2650 XM aux port -> RJ-45 -> custom cable -> DB-9 -> serial port on BBS

I took an ordinary cat5 Ethernet cable, chopped one end off and soldered it to
a DB-9 connector. This lets me plug it directly into the aux port of the Cisco
and to a free serial port of the BBS machine without any extra adapters.

![53944861067_49d75be9a4_w](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3de4ada-0ac9-485b-9cf7-f0a0b3ac3aef)

On the BBS end, DSR and DCD pins (1 and 6) are wired together. This is because
the eight positions of the aux connector wasn't enough to provide the carrier
detect (CD) signal, and Wildcat! requires a valid CD signal on the serial port
to know if a user is connected.

Thus when the router sends a connection to the BBS, it raises the DTR signal.
The BBS sees DSR and CD go active and knows to start serving the serial
connection.

But because the ring-indicate (RI) pin is not connected, another method is needed
to tell the BBS a new call has started. This is done by the Cisco emitting a
"RINGRING" banner to the serial port, and the BBS software knows when it sees this
string to "answer" the call and send a login prompt.

If the user says "goodbye" on the BBS, Wildcat will drop DTR. The Cisco sees
this as DSR being lowered and will clear the aux port and X.25/reverse-telnet
connection cleanly.

If the user drops off the network or forcefully disconnects, eventually the TCP
session with the Cisco will time out and clear the connection, cycling DSR. The
BBS will see DTR dropped and will log the user off.

```
RJ-45  (Aux)   -  DB-9
-n/a-          -  pin 9 (RI, not connected)
1 w/o  (RTS)   -  pin 8 (CTS)
2 o    (DTR)   -  pin 6 (DSR, pin 6 also jumpered to pin 1)
3 g/w  (TXD)   -  pin 2 (RXD)
4 bl   (GND)   -  pin 5 (GND)
5 bl/w (GND)   -  pin 5 (GND, blues are grounds, connect together)
6 g    (RXD)   -  pin 3 (TXD)
7 br/w (DSR)   -  pin 4 (DTR)
8 br   (CTS)   -  pin 7 (RTS)
-n/a-          -  pin 1 (DCD, jumpered to pin 6)
```

Note: if something like an Cisco NM-16A/32-A async card with the octal breakout
is used instead of the single aux port, a different pinout will need to be used.
Something like the CAB-25AS-MMOD male DB-25 modem connector will probably need
to be used since it's wired to support the DCD signal. I briefly tried this
but didn't get it working before I got distracted.

### Cisco IOS configuration

X.25-over-TCP, XOT

This is the relevant IOS configuration to act as a PAD and/or handle
reverse-telnet connections. Other common directives are omitted and
assumed to already be there.

Internet -> public IP addr port 1998/tcp -> Cisco router -> serial -> BBS

XOT translate is not yet used, but I'd like to use it in the future.
I also have an X.25 PCI card, so I may set up some sort of native X.21
connection betwen the router and a Linux host.

## Using Telebahn X.25 connectivity

A quick way to get started to try out Telebahn and TuxedoCat Lounge is to
download `xotpad`, a software X.25 PAD written in Rust. This is available
on Github: https://github.com/lowobservable/xotpad

This requires Rust and Cargo.

```
git clone https://github.com/lowobservable/xotpad.git
cd xotpad
cargo build

Binary is then in target/debug/xotpad

```

Once `xotpad` is built, it can be used similar to this, where x25.wann.net
is my XOT endpoint and 51010000 is the BBS NUA.

```
cd xotpad
./target/debug/xotpad -g x25.wann.net 51010000
```

There are other sites available on the Telebahn X.25 network to check out,
visit [X25.org](http://www.x25.org/) for more information.
